    I started my coding life with ".Net/.Net Core" (C#) solutions developer,wrote (ASP.Net /ASP.Net Core) Applications, Windows Application and Implemented end-user GPS application, then soon i understood that the web is the future.

    So lately i've been focusing on Web technology and JavaScript/Typescript language and creating solutions with Angular framework.

    And on my spare times i am the sys admin of our small company and my home servers;
    - Installed and maintaining our domain controller.
    - Implementing Git and GitLab as version controller (with all CI/CD flows).
    - And all VPN and File Sharing stuff.
    - Created my home media server and all the tests sandboxs containers.

    Oh yes i need to mention that i am a supper fan of containers (previously was fan of virtualisation).
