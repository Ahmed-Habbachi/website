  about: |
    Mainly I am a full stack developer (main stack: Angular as frontend and ASP.Net core api as backend).
    I started my coding life with ".Net/.Net Core" (C#) solutions developer, wrote (ASP.Net /ASP.Net Core) Applications, Windows Application and Services, then soon I understood that the web is the future.

    So lately I've been focusing on Web technologies and JavaScript/Typescript languages and creating solutions with Angular framework, therefore I used a lot of Azure and AWS services.

    And on my spare times I am the sys admin of our small company and my home servers;
    - Installed and maintaining our domain controller.
    - Implementing Git and GitLab as version controller (with all CI/CD flows).
    - And all VPN and File Sharing stuff.
    - Created my home media server and all the tests sandboxs containers.

    Oh yes I need to mention that I am a supper fan of containers (previously was fan of virtualisation).
